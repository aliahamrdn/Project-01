This project is a dissertation submitted to Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the MSc. In APPLIED COMPUTING.
This study investigates the optimization of intrusion detection within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) context, focusing on the comparative analysis of various machine learning algorithms. Leveraging the CICIoV2024 dataset, we evaluate the performance of different algorithms in accurately identifying and classifying intrusions in vehicular networks. Specifically, we explore the effectiveness of LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LCCDE algorithms.
